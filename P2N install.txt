Windows :
	1. Download Anaconda 3 (big installation, https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) OR Miniconda https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
	2. Install it and remember the installation PATH eg. d:\Miniconda3 for instance
	3. Download P2N latest https://github.com/Patent2net/P2N-v3
		Unzip to a temporary directory
		go to the unzipped P2N directory and edit installP2N.bat to replace d:\Miniconda3 with YOUR current installation directory (from step 2)
	4. Launch (double click) installP2N.bat 
	(let it work; do not close windows; that process can be quite long depending on you machine and network access)
	5. copy or create cles-epo.txt file (be aware must be ANSI encode caracters!)
	6. formulate the desired *.cql fileS (yes you can have many) in ./REQUESTS/ directory
	7. double click runP2N.bat
