You can enter the docker machine using the P2N_Bash.bat of Docker installation directory or launching the docker command :
.. code:: docker exec -it p2ne /bin/bash

You get root access to the machine. You should su to p2n user: `su - p2n`

.. danger:: if you break something there our answer will be to uninstall a reinstall the docker machine. 

All patent2Net scripts are accessibles in the /home/p2n/P2N-V3 directory. Enjoy.
